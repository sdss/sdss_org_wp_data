The random catalogs are designed to randomly sample the survey footprint with a density proportional to the map of the survey completeness.  Pairs of data and random catalogues are generated for samples with distinct selection functions. In BOSS, we generated LSS catalogues for the LOWZ and CMASS samples separately (see <a href=\"http://www.sdss.org/dr14/algorithms/boss_galaxy_ts/\">BOSS galaxy target selection</a> for descriptions of these samples). The LOWZ target class captures objects primarily at z < 0.4, while the CMASS class selects objects at 0.4 < z < 0.8. With DR12 we also provide a combined sample catalogue, where these two samples are optimally combined (details in <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455.1553R\">Reid et al. 2016</a>).

The WISE forced photometry assumes that all objects detected and measured by SDSS appear in the WISE images with the same morphologies, and then asks how bright those objects should be to best match the WISE data. This is useful because it allows us to extract information from the WISE images using knowledge of the existence and shapes of objects from the higher-resolution SDSS imaging. There is no need for catalog matching, and all sources get a flux measurement, even if the flux is below a formal detection limit (although low-significance flux measurements will understandably still be noisy). This allows, for example, making statistical measures of the WISE flux of classes of SDSS objects (so-called, stacking analyses).

The optical counterparts were found by optimally searching photometric data for the existence of a red-sequence formed by their member galaxies. Spectroscopic redshifts obtained by SPIDERS (in the SEQUELS programme) provide definitive confirmation of the clustered nature of these objects and their redshift (up to z~0.6). We assigned cluster membership combining an algorithm and visual validation of individual objects. The gas properties derived from X-ray observations (luminosity, temperature, R<sub>200</sub>) are derived using precise cluster redshifts (&Delta;z ~ 0.001). We compute galaxy cluster velocity dispersions using several methods adapted to the low number of spectroscopic members per system (of the order 15-40) and we show that their values correlate with cluster X-ray luminosities, within expectations.\r\n\r\nThe relevant FITS file for this VAC is <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr14/eboss/spiders/analysis/catCluster-SPIDERS_RASS_CLUS-v1.0.fits\"> catCluster-SPIDERS_RASS_CLUS-v1.0.fits</a>.

This catalog lists the BCGs identified as part of this process, along with their stellar mass, star formation rates (SFR), and morphological properties. BCGs are identified based on the available spectroscopic data from SPIDERS and photometric data from SDSS (Erfanianfar et al. in prep). Only those SPIDERS clusters which have one component in the SPIDERS X-ray galaxy clusters are considered in this analysis. Stellar masses and SFRs of the BCGs are computed by combining SDSS, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/main/index.html\">WISE</a> and <a href=\"http://galex.caltech.edu/\">GALEX</a> photometry, and using state-of-the-art spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.

In order to facilitate studies that require UV coverage with matching spatial resolution, we have cross-matched MaNGA DR15 catalog with galaxies observed by <a href=\"https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/about_swift/uvot_desc.html\">Swift UVOT</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.swift.ac.uk/archive/\">Swift archive</a> and created the Swift+MaNGA (SwiM) value added catalog, which comprises 150 galaxies. \r\n\r\nBesides a catalog that includes the integrated photometry from Swift, this VAC also includes a large number of emission line and spectral indices maps, Swift UVOT images (uvw1, uvw2, and uvm2), SDSS ugriz images, all matched to the same angular resolution and spatial sampling as the uvw2 band. This will allow spatially resolved studies with consistent binning and resolution across UV and optical imaging, and optical spectroscopy. For the Lick indices maps, we adopted the older definition (<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984ApJ...287..586B/abstract\">Burstein et al. 1984</a>; <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJS...57..711F/abstract\">Faber et al. 1985</a>) to define the continuum, which would allow more convenient spatial binning and comparison with composite stellar population model.

SDSS quasar catalogs have a long history of visually inspecting quasar spectra for improved classifications, redshifts, and features of interest. These catalogs are broadly useful to the community, but also have general utility by finding archetypical and problematic objects to help test automated spectroscopic reduction and classification pipelines. In that vein, DR16Q is the largest and final quasar catalog from SDSS-IV/eBOSS, and comprises both a \"superset\" of more than 1.44 million quasar-targeted spectroscopic observations (DR16Q_Superset_v3), and a quasar-only catalog (DR16Q_v4) with more than 920,000 observations of 750,000 quasars. The quasar-only catalog includes multi-wavelength photometric data cross-matched from the following external surveys: GALEX, UKIDSS, WISE, FIRST, 2MASS, ROSAT/2RXS, XMM-Newton, and Gaia.\r\n\r\nDR16Q provides the largest number of redshift estimates, per quasar, for an SDSS quasar VAC, including redshifts from previous catalogs (DR7Q, DR12Q), two sets of \"Hewett and Wild\" improved redshifts (DR6; <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.405.2302H/abstract\">Hewett and Wild 2010</a>, DR7Q; <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..194...45S/abstract\">Shen et al. 2011</a>), automated eBOSS pipeline redshifts, visual inspection redshifts, PCA-derived redshifts, and six emission line redshifts for H\u03b1, H\u03b2, Mg II, C III], C IV, and Ly\u03b1. Information on damped Lyman alpha (DLA) and broad absorption line (BAL) quasars was included from automated algorithms for 35,686 DLAs and 99,856 BALs.

These candidates were spectroscopically detected within <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr16/eboss/spectro/redux/v5_13_0/\">v5_13_0</a> using the algorithm of the BELLS and SLACS surveys (<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...744...41B\">Brownstein et al. 2012</a>) while adding new inspection tools upon the predecessor's inspection methods to better refine the sample (<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200709006T/abstract\">Talbot et al. 2020</a>).\r\n\r\nThe catalog contains 288 candidates that display two or more detected emission-line candidates with high signal-to-noise and 1263 detections that demonstrate an OII(b,a) doublet with high signal-to-noise. The catalog contains detection results, foreground subtraction data, emission-line information derived from Gaussian fits, and imaging from the SDSS Legacy Survey and from the <a href=\"https://www.legacysurvey.org/decamls/\">DeCam Legacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.legacysurvey.org/mzls/\">Mayall z-band Legacy</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.legacysurvey.org/bass/\">Beijing-Arizona Sky</a> surveys contained within the <a href=\"https://www.legacysurvey.org/\">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey</a>. These new tools enable the user to examine detection signals and observe probable lensing features, as was observed in 477 images during the inspection process. With more than 838 detections surpassing the BELLS criteria, this survey largely surpasses the candidate count of previous surveys, which was made possible since most of the 2 million galaxies in the BOSS/eBOSS surveys were not searched for common emission-lines of background sources.\r\n\r\nFor more details on this catalog, please see <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200709006T/abstract\">Talbot et al.

(2016)</a> for all galaxies in MaNGA DR15. This is the original implementation of the Shape Asymmetry algorithm. The code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/SEDMORPH/PawlikMorph\">here</a>. \r\n\r\nThe current version of the code does not mask stars prior to creating the 8-connected binary mask, therefore stars within the extended light of the galaxies cause incorrect measurements. More than 10% of objects have been inspected by eye using <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr16/help/glossary/#Marvin\">Marvin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr16/help/glossary/#skyserver\">SkyServer</a>, and the WARNINGFLAG set where a star is detected either in the MaNGA datacube, or in the SDSS imaging. In particular, all otherwise clean objects with M20 > -1 or As > 0.3 or (apixx-71)^2+(apixy-71)^2 > 150 have been visually inspected. Users should only use measurements where WARNINGFLAG=0, and additionally visually inspect outliers to ensure that any sample is clean before doing science. We hope to improve the code for future releases. \r\n  \r\nThe WARNINGFLAG bits are: (0) failure internal to code; (1) catastrophic error not causing failure of code (e.g. imgsize=0 or rmax=0); (2) problem defining position of minimum asymmetry which indicates further problems with other measurements; (3) sample of outliers with reff = 1 and As > 0.3; (4) particularly large mask with rmax > 90; (5) visually identified failure. We recommend not using any measurement where any of the warning flags are set. Absent measurements are additionally indicated by values of -99. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "approve": true,
            "abstract": "APOGEE's target selection algorithm includes many red-clump (RC) stars in the APOGEE sample. A new method for identifying red-clump stars from spectrophotometric data and its application to the APOGEE data was presented in <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790..127B\">Bovy et al. (2014)</a>. This technique creates a very pure sample of red-clump stars with minimal contamination from red-giant-branch, secondary-red-clump, and asymptotic-giant-branch stars. The narrowness of the RC locus in color-metallicity-luminosity space allows distances to the stars to be assigned with an accuracy of 5%-10%. The purity is estimated to be about 95%. The DR17 catalog is the latest version of the APOGEE RC catalog, and contains 50,837 stars. \r\n\r\nThe DR17 catalog is created in the same manner as the DR16 and DR14 catalogs. In APOGEE DR17, log g is calibrated for both the red giant branch (RGB) stars and the RC, so the DR17 RC catalog just makes use of the catalog (calibrated) log g to select RC stars. However, as in DR16 and DR14, we have made the upper log g cut 0.1 dex more stringent (equation 2 in the paper above) to account for some changes in how log g was calibrated. We also use the additional, conservative log g cut that was used in both DR11 and DR12.\r\n\r\nSection 4 of <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790..127B\">Bovy et al. (2014)</a> described how to correct for observational biases due to the APOGEE target selection (for the whole (J-Ks)0 > 0.5 sample, not just the red-clump sample). Specifically, these are the biases due to the incomplete sampling of the available targets with (J-Ks)0 > 0.5 as a function of position on the sky and magnitude. Tools to correct for these biases are included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jobovy/apogee\">apogee python package</a> and extensive documentation on how to use this package is given on the package webpage. This selection-function code has been updated for DR13 (from the DR11 version described in the paper). DR13, like DR11 and DR12, contains only stars observed in APOGEE-1. DR14 is the first release containing stars observed in APOGEE-2, which has different targeting criteria than APOGEE-1. \r\n\r\nSection 5 of <a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790..127B\">Bovy et al. (2014)</a> discussed astrophysical biases due to the red-clump selection. Specifically, they investigated the biases in recovering the underlying age and metallicity distribution by only selecting red-clump stars. The RC selection preferentially select stars with ages between 1 and 4 Gyr and with metallicities > -0.9. Please consult section 5 of the paper above for full details. The <a href=\"https://github.com/jobovy/apogee\">apogee python package</a> also has tools for working with the astrophysical biases. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you also use the latest updated catalog (DR17), but previous versions of the APOGEE RC catalog are still available. The DR16 catalog contains 39,675 stars and can be found <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr16/apogee/vac/apogee-rc/cat/apogee-rc-DR16.fits\">here</a>, with its content described in the data model available <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/APOGEE_RC/cat/apogee-rc-DR16.html\">here</a>. Similarly, the DR14 catalog contains 29,502 stars and can be found <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr14/apogee/vac/apogee-rc/cat/apogee-rc-DR14.fits\">here</a>, with its data model available <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/APOGEE_RC/cat/apogee-rc-DR14.html\">here</a>. The DR13 catalog was selected based on the more accurate set of spectroscopic parameters from the overall DR13 APOGEE release and therefore suffered from less contamination than previously released catalogs, leading to a slight decrease in the number of RC stars in the DR13 catalog compared to the DR12 catalog. The DR13 catalog contains 19,291 stars and is available <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr13/apogee/vac/apogee-rc/cat/apogee-rc-DR13.fits\">on the SAS</a>; its contents are described in the <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/APOGEE_RC/cat/apogee-rc-DR13.html\">datamodel</a>. \r\n\r\nThe older DR11 and DR12 catalog versions are also still available.

Recent efforts have translated these simulations into catalogs of observables, collectively known as the Ananke simulations, that provide the key Gaia observables for the star particles in the simulations (<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..246....6S/abstract\">Sanderson et al. 2020</a>); these include radial velocity, proper motion, chemistry (10 chemical elements are tracked in the simulation), parallax, and photometry in the Gaia bands, among others. Because the input physics and the global structure of the model galaxy are known, these mock catalogs provide a rare experimental laboratory to make connections between the resolved stellar populations and global galaxy studies -- the key driver in the Milky Way as a Galaxy working group (MWAG). With <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..106N/abstract\">Nikakhtar et al. (2021)</a>, the Ananke simulations are updated with APOGEE-2 specific properties (e.g., selection photometry) and are suitable for broad use. With this VAC, we provide the APOGEE-suitable simulations along-side the APOGEE-2 data providing a unique tool for Galactic inferences. \r\n\r\nEach of the 9 synthetic surveys (3 different simulations, 3 different Solar positions per sim) has a total of 10 subfiles sliced by heliocentric distance for easier transport.

It extends the `MaNGA PyMorph DR15 photometric VAC' to now include galaxies which were added to make the final DR17. For all the galaxies, we use the PyMorph algorithm for determining the fits. PyMorph has been extensively tested (<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433.1344M/abstract\">Meert et al. 2013</a>; <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.467..490F/abstract\">Fischer et al. 2017</a>; <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.2569B/abstract\">Bernardi et al. 2017</a>) and PyMorph reductions of about 670,000 galaxies of the SDSS DR7 Main Galaxy Sample are available (the UPenn SDSS Photdec Catalogue: <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.3943M/abstract\">Meert et al. 2015</a>, <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455.2440M/abstract\">2016</a>). Since about 15% of the MaNGA galaxies were not included in that analysis, we have re-run PyMorph for all the galaxies in the MaNGA DR17 sample. These re-runs incorporate three improvements:  they use the SDSS DR14 images, improved bulge-to-disk decomposition by slightly modifying our criteria when using PyMorph, and all the fits in this catalogue have been eye-balled, and re-fit if necessary, for additional reliability (see <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.2057F/abstract\">Fischer et al. 2019</a> and  <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp.2822D/abstract\">Dom\u00ednguez S\u00e1nchez et al. 2021</a> for details). We recommend using `FLAG_FIT'.\r\n\r\nNote that the position angle PA_PyMorph given in this catalogue is with respect to the camera columns in the SDSS ''fpC'' images (which are not aligned with the North direction); to convert to the usual convention where North is up, East is left (note that the MaNGA datacubes have North up, East right) set PA_MaNGA = (90-PA_PyMorph) - SPA, where SPA is the SDSS camera column position angle with respect to North reported in the primary header of the ''fpC'' SDSS images. PA_MaNGA is defined to increase from East towards North. In contrast to the DR15 release where the SPA angles were provided in a separate file, this DR17 catalog includes the SPA angles.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you always use the latest updated catalog (DR17).

            "abstract": "This value added catalog provides resolved and integrated (aperture-corrected) stellar masses for galaxies in MaNGA DR17. The resolved masses are found by adopting a reduced spectral-fitting space derived from principal component analysis of 40000 synthetic spectra of continuous stellar populations, and using the goodness-of-fit of each synthetic spectrum for a given observed spectrum, to define a marginalized posterior probability density function for the i-band stellar mass-to-light ratio. The median of that distribution is adopted as the fiducial stellar mass-to-light ratio of a spaxel (line of sight in a galaxy), and multiplied by the i-band luminosity to get an estimate for the stellar mass. Stellar mass-to-light ratios have been vetted against synthetic spectra, and found to be reliable at median signal-to-noise ratios between 2 and 20, across a wide range of dust attenuation conditions, and across the full range of realistic stellar metallicities. Typical 'random' uncertainties are approximately 0.1 dex (including age-metallicity degeneracies and uncertainties induced by imperfect spectrophotometry), and systematic uncertainties could be as high as 0.3 dex, but we believe are more realistically 0.1 to 0.15 dex (see <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...883...82P/abstract\">Pace et al. 2019</a>). We include several data-quality metrics, to help the user decide which data are reliable for their purposes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to resolved maps of stellar mass-to-light ratio and i-band luminosity, we will soon release a full catalog of total stellar-masses for DR17. One column gives the total mass inside the <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr17/help/glossary/#ifu\">IFU</a> (after interpolating over foreground stars and unreliable measurements). We also supply two possible masses intended to correct for mass falling outside the spatial grasp of the IFU: the first adopts the median stellar mass-to-light ratio of the outermost 0.5 effective radii, and the second adopts a mass-to-light ratio consistent with the (g - r) color of the <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr17/manga/manga-target-selection/nsa/\">NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA)</a> flux minus the flux in the IFU (see <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...883...83P/abstract\">Pace et al. 2019b,</a>).\r\n\r\nThe python code used to generate this VAC can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/zpace/pcay\">Github</a>.

The candidates are spectroscopically detected within co-added foreground subtracted row-stacked-spectra (RSS), in which spectra are stacked across exposures from the same fiber located at the same dither position so a sigma-clipping method can reject transient signals. The target and candidate overview information, spectra information, and emission-line analysis information are split into three extensions. Nearly all candidate background galaxies are highly assured but only source grade A through C represent if a candidate is suspected to be lensed. \r\n\r\nThe summary file (silo_manga_detections-[SILO_VER].fits, available <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr17/manga/spectro/lensing/silo/v3_1_1/1.0.4/silo_manga_detections-1.0.4.fits\">here</a>) contains information on each candidate system, detections for each source or background candidate, and measurements for candidate emission lines. Data on spectra used in the lens search and spaxels constructed by SILO are recorded in files within each <a href=\"https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr17/manga/spectro/lensing/silo/v3_1_1/1.0.4/\">plate directory</a> ([PLATE]/manga_[PLATE]_[IFU]_stack_data.fits).

Further more the dataset includes four datacubes that comprises the spatial resolved properties required to recover the star-formation histories, the average properties of the stellar populations, the emission line properties for 192 strong and weak emission lines (including the former ones together with the EW of the lines), and the most frequently used stellar indices, as described in the previous articles. For each galaxy we provide these four datacubes packed together as extensions in a single FITS file.

The <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr17/mastar/\">MaStar project</a> has produced the largest library of high quality stellar spectra up to date. In this value-added catalog, we present stellar parameter measurements using several different methods. \r\n\r\nMany applications of the library depend on having accurate stellar parameters for each spectrum. The MaStar working group has carried out multiple efforts to derive stellar parameters using different methods. Here we combine the multiple sets of parameters into a single value-added catalog, containing both the individual sets of stellar parameters and a master set combining the best measurements from all sets. The stellar parameters we present include the effective temperature (T_eff), the surface gravity (log g), the Iron-to-Hydrogen ratio ([Fe/H]), the total metallicity ([Z/H]), and the Alpha-to-Iron ratio ([alpha/Fe]). \r\n\r\nDifferent methods and templates are used to derive the parameters. In the catalog these are labelled as DL (led by Daniel Lazarz at University of Kentucky), JI (led by Julie Imig at New Mexico State University), LH (led by Lewis Hill at University of Portsmouth), YC (led by Yanping Chen at New York University Abu Dhabi). These methods are described in detail on the <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr17/mastar/mastar-stellar-parameters/\">MaStar Stellar Parameters webpage</a>.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions of this VAC. Version 1 (v1) was released on Dec 7, 2021 and version 2 (v2) was released in September 2022. \r\nIn v2, three of the four parameter measurement methods (DL, LH, and YC) were updated to produce more accurate and robust measurements, with better quality control. Therefore, we recommend using v2 for all purposes. Both versions are available on the Science Archive Server (SAS). On the Catalog Archive Server (CAS), v1 is available under the DR17 context and v2 will be available under the DR18 context (expected in December 2022).\r\n",

In order to exploit the over 100 million stellar objects with r < 22.5 mag observed by SDSS, we need to understand the characteristics of stars in the SDSS ugriz filters. While star clusters provide important calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globular clusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded for the standard SDSS photometric pipeline to process. To complement the SDSS imaging survey, we reduce the SDSS imaging data for crowded cluster fields using the DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME suite of programs and present photometry for 17 globular clusters and three open clusters in a SDSS value-added catalog. Our photometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native SDSS 2.5 m ugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied to the SDSS photometry without relying on any transformations.

We updated the spectroscopic redshift and classifications (w.r.t. Salvato et al. 2022), using a large spectroscopic compilation, derived from several facilities, but dominated by SDSS optical spectroscopy. We included new information derived from 37 dedicated SDSS-V plates, observed between December 2020 and May 2021. We combined automated redshift and classifications, derived from the <a href=\"https://www.sdss.org/dr18/software/pipelines/boss/\">standard SDSS idlspec1d pipeline</a>, with an extensive and targeted set of visual inspections, which increase the reliability and completeness of the spectroscopic coverage. \r\n\r\nWe provide three files:\r\ni) eFEDS_Main_speccomp - an update of redshift/classification information for the eFEDS Main (0.2-2.3keV selection) source counterparts catalogue;\r\nii) eFEDS_Hard_speccomp - an update of redshift/classification information for the eFEDS Hard band (2.3-5keV selection) source counterparts catalogue; \r\niii) eFEDS_SDSSV_spec_results - a catalogue of spectroscopic redshifts and classifications derived solely from the SDSS-V/eFEDS plate data set, supplemented by the results of an extensive visual inspection process. \r\n\r\nA full description of this value added catalog will be provided in Merloni et al. (in prep). ",
